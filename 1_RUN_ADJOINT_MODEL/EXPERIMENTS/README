First, run a nonlinear model trajectory using
	namelist.TRAJ60
	namelist_ice.TRAJ60
	TRAJ60.sh
Modify job_JOBNAME.sh according to local system requirements (see comments in script).

Then can generate experiment directories for the different adjoint simulations using
     mkdirs.sh
which makes copies of
      job_JOBNAME.sh
      namelist.TEMPLATE
in directories specific to each adjoint experiment
